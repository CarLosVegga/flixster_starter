### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes. I felt confident at using API to fetch data thanks to lab 3. I also learned how to use javascript to inject HTML code thanks to lab 2, and I was able to create css animations thanks to lab 1. I feel prepared to complete also the stretch features, but because of time I will update that later.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added a select to see movies according to the movie genre. I could have also prevented movies without posters to display on screen (or change the poster to a default value).

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Most of the demo went as planned. The things that went unplanned to the best of my knowledge I detected them and I was able to correct them. I would like to improve the design tho.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
I would like to give my shout out to Vincent. He was also supportive and patient to help us figure out how to solve our problems. Also big thanks to our group, for always been open to share ideas and solve doubts.
